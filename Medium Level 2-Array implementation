1.You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array . 
Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 
Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 

2.Write a program  to replace every element in an array with the sum of its right side elements

3.Write a program  to reverse the array elements

4.Write a program  to insert the value at given position in the array.

5.Write a program  to delete the value at given position from the array.

6.Write a program  to swap every pair of  adjacent array elements

7.Write a program  to left rotate for given times of an array elements

8.Write a program  to remove the duplicates in an array .

9.Write a program  to find second largest and second smallest in array

10. Given two sorted arrays, find their union and intersection.
Input: arr1[] = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
        arr2[] = {2, 3, 5, 6} 
Output: Union : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 
         Intersection : {3, 5}
